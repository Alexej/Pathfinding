# Visualization of D* lite pathfinding algorithm. Not done yet.
## Libraries used: SFML, IMGUI, Catch2

## Functionality:
---
* Start and Goal positions can be changed.  <br/>
* Edge cost can be increased.  <br/>
* Resizable graph.  <br/>
* Node info is rendered(if nodes are large enough) and also shown in the Menu.  <br/>
* A* can be run in parallel with D* lite at each step.  <br/>
* No major bugs as far sa I know.  <br/>
* Easy language for testcases.  <br/>

## Demos:

## TODO:
---
* More tests.  <br/>
* Documentation.  <br/>
* Overall design improvements  <br/>
* Better naming  <br/>
